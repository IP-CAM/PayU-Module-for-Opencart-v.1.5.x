Merge the files and folders in the PayU India module with the Open cart module. In other words, copy the end files/folders in the integration kit sent to you manually according to the files and folder structure.
For e.g.: The file admin/controller/payment/payu.php in the integration kit is pasted in the following directory in the opencart folder – www/opencart/upload/admin/controller/payment.
If you do not find any folder of Payu Plugin then, please paste the whole folder (including file) in that path.
The idea is to transfer files/folders from the last matching folder in the integration kit to the last matching folder in the open cart folder. Please notice that the path admin/controller/payment are same in the above mentioned example.

Step 2:
Please go to your OpenCart Admin panel.
